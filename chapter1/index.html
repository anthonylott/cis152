<p>D'USSÃ‰ (pronounced "dew-say") is a brand of premium French Cognac. It features a smooth and complex flavor profile with notes of fruit, spice, and honey, due to aging in French oak barrels. I like to mix mine with Simply Lemonade. You have to be careful when drinking this because it will sneak up on you.</p>
